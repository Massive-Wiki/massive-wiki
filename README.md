# Massive Wiki

## Welcome to Massive Wiki

Featuring easy linking and named pages, **Wiki** is one of the best ways to organize and share text-based information and knowledge. Wiki was first developed by Ward Cunningham in 1994. 

**Massive Wiki** turns the usual centralized wiki system inside-out, using simple text files shared by the wiki participants, located on their personal devices. Revisions are tracked automatically, allowing participants to review past versions. Optionally, the wiki can be published to the web as HTML files.

Massive Wiki is a collection of open source practices and tools that help you:

- build a wiki for one person (a personal wiki, knowledge garden, or PKM)
- build a collaborative wiki for multiple people
- publish your wiki to a website
