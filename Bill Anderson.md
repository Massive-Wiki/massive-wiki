# Bill Anderson

## What about me?
A retired data informatician, socio-technical systems engineer, and chemist. Also an open access advocate and inveterate punster.

When asked recently about what I value and my interests I responded with "Kindness, curiosity, honesty, and humor. I am interested in learning about, examining, and promoting abundance-based models and ideas of sustainable human societies."

I am also reviewing my childhood first-order learnings about how the world works.

Birth year atmospheric CO2 concentration [from ice core data](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/trends/co2/lawdome.combined.dat): 310 ppm
